# Perceptron Learning Algorithm(PLA)
Use Perceptron Learning Algorithm(PLA) to training data until all data are coorect.

## Problem Description
In this assignment, I have to read the data in random sequence, and compute how many updating times it is when no mistake happen.

## Data Description
In 'perceptron_train.dat', each line have five values, first four values for feature(or attributes), and last one for label.

for instance:

0.97681 0.10723 0.64385 0.29556	1

## Use Language & Packages
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas

## To Start
I use Jupyter notebook to finish this assignment, you can open it with jupyter and compile the code.

## Output
I output a histogram which describe the relation between updating times and its frequency when I read the taining file with differnet random sequence.
