I listed what I had done for each assignment below:
- [Assignment 0](https://github.com/john850512/Intelligent_System/tree/master/Assignment0): Use Python to change picture RGB value
- [Assignment 1](https://github.com/john850512/Intelligent_System/tree/master/Assignment1): Use `LinearRegression` to predict PM2.5 value
- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/john850512/Intelligent_System/tree/master/Assignment2): Use `Perceptron Learning Algorithm(PLA)` to training 
- [Assignment 3](https://github.com/john850512/Intelligent_System/tree/master/Assignment3): Use `Logistic Regression(with SGD strategy)` to predict whether a person is rich / poor

- [Final Project](https://github.com/john850512/Intelligent_System/tree/master/FinalProject_ECGClassifier): Use ` LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)` to classifier Arrhythmia.
